# EasyMatter

A web application that makes MatterGen accessible to non-scientists for designing materials with a chat-based UI powered by OpenAI's API.

## Overview

EasyMatter enables non-scientists to design new materials, catalysts, or modified materials using MatterGen, with a conversational UI that interprets plain-language inputs, restricts inputs to a user-uploaded cost/availability dataset, and outputs ready-to-run Colab code.

## Features

- Intuitive, conversational UI for material design
- OpenAI-powered natural language interpretation
- Templates for common material design goals
- Cost and availability constraints via user-defined datasets
- Google Colab code generation for running MatterGen
